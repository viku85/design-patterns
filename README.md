# Design Patterns [In-Progress]
This is going to be the main repository for all design patterns that we have used or learned. We would see very simple examples of design pattern locates in each sub-folders. It might contain different programming languages.

We would try to give practical examples with real-life scenarios where those can be used, clarification on any associated confusion or co-relation with another design pattern which looks similar. Documentation shall be extensive so that we can easily understand.
