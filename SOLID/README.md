# SOLID

I believe any developer no matter what experience you have should read about SOLID and learn those principals which help out in the improvement of code quality and manageability for future modification.

It consists of these principles and abbreviations:

- S: [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](SRP/README.md).
- O: Open/Close Principle.
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle.
- I: Interface Segregation Principle.
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle.

Please follow links for each of them to get more understanding in each area.
